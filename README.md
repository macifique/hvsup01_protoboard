# hvsup01_protoboard
Proto board for HVSUP01

This is a small 90mm x 60mm board that demonstrates the capabilities of he HVSUP01 sensor. 
The board acts as a batery uperated IOT device using an ESP-07 or ESP-12 low cost Wifi module.

It is powered by an ER17505 Lithium-thinoyl Chloride battery from Eve. The battery is directly soldered to the board.

Based on the GM tube properties and the selected wifi module, the standby power consumption may be less than 100uA. 
The HVSUP01 module can be configured to wake up the wifi module at selected intervals to report the actual radiation value to an IOT server.

The board was created with Designspark PCB 8
